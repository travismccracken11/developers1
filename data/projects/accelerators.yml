description: "The DEX UI and DEX UI Components serve as accelerators for building a Decentralized Exchange on a Hashgraph based network.
    The DEX UI leverages React primitives from the DEX UI component library, facilitating the creation of user-friendly, efficient, and scalable DEX interfaces.
    These tools are designed for developers looking to contribute to or develop their own DEX platforms within the ecosystem, streamlining the process with ready-to-use components and a comprehensive UI framework."
