title: "Transaction Tool"
description: "The Transaction Tool is an application capable of signing and submitting transactions to a Hashgraph based network.
    It was designed to support multi-sig operations such as those required by the Hedera governing council.
    Currently, this tool should be considered a demo application and unsuitable for widespread use.
    A new implementation of the transaction tool is under construction.
    It will be generally useful for developers using the network to create, sign, and submit every kind of transaction to a Hashgraph ledger."
